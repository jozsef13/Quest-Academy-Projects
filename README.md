Projects using Design Patterns!

The problem Rabbit is a mini-game which involves players, as rabbits, which are moving on a field where they can find prizes. Each rabbit 
has a set of movements, and depending on which side of the field is placed, it will go north, south, east or west, but when he encounters
a prize, which he will take, it will change his movement. Each rabbit will "die" when he gets outside of the field, and when all 
of them are out, the game finishes.

The second project, RabbitsGUI, it represents the mini-game from above, but done with a GUI using Java Swing and MVC design patterns. Here
I added some extra things beside the initial problem statement done in the project from above.

The final project, eMAG Hero, it is also a mini-game, where a fight between our hero, which has some abilities, life points, and other attributes
and a monster, which has some attributes, is simulated until one of them remains without life.


All this projects were done using OOP references and Design Patterns. More informations about these problem can be found in their directories where the problem statement is written in a pdf or word file.
